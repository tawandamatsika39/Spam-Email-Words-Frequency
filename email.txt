INTRODUCTION


Our Guide to Importing & Exporting will introduce you to the world of international business from a beginner's perspective, highlighting critical resources that exist with each of the eight steps. This comprehensive package will teach you how to get started in international trade. This training is recommended for anyone who has never exported or imported before or is interested in learning more about the overall process.

 

International Trade -  Education and Training

Ranging from importing to exporting, compliance to government laws, harmonized code classifications to cross-cultural communications, the programme offered through the NORCAZ ACADEMY addresses the full outline of global trade and business.

 

Our facilitator will provide in-depth review and real-world examples on the following topics:

    Introduction to and review of basic trade & transport documents,
    How the documentation process affects payment and customs clearance,
    Incoterms,
    Import / Export regulations and compliance,
    Role of a freight forwarder,
    The importance of cargo insurance,
    Payment methods (letters of credit, etc)
    Temporary exports, and the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

 

Over the last decade, the world has taken notice of the potential the African continent holds. According to US research house Frost & Sullivan, Sub-Saharan trade volumes are expected to quadruple by 2030 and intra-regional trade volumes are expected to increase by around 350% over this time

 

With this POTENTIAL around the corner - why are we not exporting more to our neighbouring countries or further up the continent already?

    Avoid costly mistakes by understanding the ‘wheel’ of trade and its different facets
